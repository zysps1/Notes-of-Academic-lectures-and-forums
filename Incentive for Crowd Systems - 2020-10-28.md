### Examples

#### 1. Crowd voting

#### 2. Federated learning

#### 3. On-demand ride sharing

### Incentive Issues of Crowd Systems

#### 1. Incomplete information

#### 2. Hidden actions

#### 3. Dynamic avilability

#### 4. Bounded rationality

### Information Elicitation in Crowdsourcing

#### Crowdsourcing

* Crowdsourced workers finish tasks with costs
  * Need rewards as incentive
* A naive way: provide rewards based on workload
  * Workers tend to finish many tasks with low effort (low quality)
  * workers may report untruthful solutions
* First Case: Verifiable Information
  * Key challenges
    * How to identify private worker capability?
    * How to optimally select workers and aggregate their reports based on capability and costs?
* Second Case: Unverifiable Information
  * No ground truth or large cost for ground truth
  * Under-explored
* Result of Prof. Huang's group
  * majority voting mechanism
  * truth detection mechanism
  * online learning mechanism
