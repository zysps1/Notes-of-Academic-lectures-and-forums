### Section 1-Outline

GT: analyzes multi-agent interactions

AI: study and construction of rational agent

> before: agents are controlled by one leader
>
> Now: multi-agents cooperate with each other to finish some tasks, which can be a big problem. And GT analyzes the conflicts of **distributed** AI

GT for AI: success for computer poker, auction, security ...

> Example: Google/Baidu keywords auction

The rest of the talk: Bo An's recent work along GT+AI

> With data or without data?
>
> Pure Game theory or not pure?

### Section 2-Introduction and examples

Notice:

* The process of solving GT problem is quite difficult
* Example: Tsinghua: Yao Qizhi

Fields:

* Libratus for computer Poker

> why choose this field to study?
>
> > 1. well-defined field
> > 2. relevant with other scientific fields
>
> Introduction: Poker is different from Alpha Go. The key is the number of players.
>
> For one to one poker game, there can be a good solution of GT.
>
> But for one to many poker game, there exists a lot of problems that can not be solved by using GT
>
> > Recent development
> >
> > > one situation: a man is competing with four men who are in a team. Then there must be the sixth man to participate in the game who can inform the four men(in the most cases, are bad guys) of the information of all the players.
> > >
> > > another situation(studied by Bo An): a man is competing with four men who are in a team. However, there will be no other people participating in this game. And the four man share information and set a strategy that could help them win the game in a high probability before the start of the game.

* Security games

> Very hard to define a complex situation.
>
> The enemies may take adversarial actions or spread mendacious information to maze the decision-making agent. 

### Section 3-Recent work

* Real time schedule police from several stations to catch bad guys.
* Combating fraud in E-commerce via Deep RL

* GT for urban intelligence
* Dynamic electronic road pricing(ERP)
* Two to two game
* Joint pricing and dispatch (DIDI scheduling)
* Extensive corporation using DRL
* Recommend algorithm to ALL deep RL

### Section 4-What's next

* Stochastic, open environment
* multiple players
* Sequential decision, online
* Strategic(selfish) behavior
* Distributed optimization
* multi-agents game
